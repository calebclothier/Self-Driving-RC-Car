# Self Driving RC Car
In order to graduate, every senior at my high school has to complete a project. I decided to modify a cheap RC car to be controlled by an onboard Raspberry Pi connected to several sonar sensors and a Pi camera. Below I will try to explain how I built both the hardware and the software for the car.
## Car Specifications
Below is a picture of the car that I used for this project. It is a 1:14 scale BMW X6 manufactured by Costzon, and it only cost around $30.

The car is powered by 5 AA batteries, and the two DC motors controlling steering and throttle are on/off â€“ in other words, there are no degrees of steering or speed. 
## Tools and Parts
